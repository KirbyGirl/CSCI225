            <p>Heya! Name's Cheyenne, I'm a general Comp Sci major in what I hope is my final year and a half of college. I like to draw, hike, sing, and read.
                My favorite color is blue, though if I had to choose any other color it would probably be green. I'm extremely shy and have social anxiety which
                tends to make me a very awkward human being. I've learned to like my weirdness, though.
                Here is something I designed for my Graphic Design Class: 
            </p>
            <img src="img/Hope.jpg">
            <hr>
            <p>Something else about little ole me....</p>
                <p>
                Well, I'm older than I look, but I do usually like to make people guess just how old I actually am.
                Who knows how long I'll be able to actually do that, right? It's like my own little chance to play 
                Loki or Rumpelstiltskin, the only difference being I have no cool magical powers to give you a reward
                if you guess right. Before you say money, I'm broke enough as is.
                </p>
                <p>
                If I'm being honest, I have a tendency to be a bit of a smart-ass when you get to know me, but I'm extremely shy.
                It doesn't always seem like it, it's like there's this switch in my brain for my anxiety and either it causes
                me to ramble to no end (I will get pretty close to telling you my life story on those days, but you'll also hear me 
                apologize more than a few times. Apologizing for my existance is what I'm good at, what can I say?), or other days
                 I will hardly even make eye contact out of fear people will think I'm staring too much.
                </p>
                <p>
                All this to say, I am a fairly awkward person at the core of it all. But I'm trying my best.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>Another fun fact you - the reader - may have already noticed: I have a memory that is only
                 slightly better than that of a goldfish. I will admit I have forgotten my own age once, but
                 it was only like a "am I really turning this age?!" kind of moment. Which could happen to you too
                  if you're older than you look and have a horrible memory like mine.
            </p>
            <p>Some of my siblings (of which I have 6 total. 5 sisters, 1 brother, not all from the same parents and that
                 well, that is a whole other story in itself that we aren't gonna delve into today) and I like to joke that
                 I might actually be a vampire. This is also because of my pale skin, the fact that I have 2 sets 
                 of k-9 teeth, and because I tend to be more of a night owl.
            </p>

            <p>Alright, I'm just making this as kind of a small aside that I may not even keep up with.
            But, for the moment at least, my brain can sometimes get so noisy it can be hard for me to
            articulate how I'm feeling, or properly show people who I am.
            </p>
            <p>So, what better place to try to get my thoughts out coherently than right here in the 'late night thoughts'
                section of code I just added to my webpage? <br>
                Alright, that should be good for now. <em id="sig">Sleep well my lovelies</em> <sub><img src="img/logo.png" alt="logo"></sub>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>Not really a <em id="sig">Late Night</em> and less thoughts, more a dull twitch in my fingers, a tenseness in my shoulders:
            <br>the need to put feelings into words so they don't swallow me whole.</p>
            <p>The absolute desperation to put meaning to the weight on my chest before is has the chance to suffocate me.
                <br><em id="sig">or drive me even more insane than I already am.</em> 
                <br>If that's even possible.
            </p>
            <p>I get really worried that anything I do or say may come across the wrong way. Honestly, I frequently have
                "why am I like this???" moments.Even now, as I'm typing my anxiety sits on my shoulder.
                A <em>very much unwanted guest</em>.
                <br>So, in the spirit of trying not to be so down (and because the song got stuck in my head (AND I want to
                practice adding audio to my website.)) here is U from Belle: <br>

                ...but rather than working on that I'm pouting in bed because I'm punishing myself for not
                doing it yet by not reading more of one of my current obsessions - <em id="sig">Fairytale by Stephen King</em>

            <p>A book I felt was so amazing I had to put it down after getting halfway through because I knew I wasn't ready
                for the world that King had prepared for his readers in this new(ish) fantasy story that brings together the wonder 
                of.....well.....Wonderland, the eerie horror of <em id="sig">H.P. Lovecraft</em>, aaaaaaand has a mysterious city that is
                both famous and infamous that you have to take a certain stone-like road to get to. I'll leave you to speculate what pop-culture
                that might relate to. I'm going to be getting back to that beautiful book soon. But first, midterm project.

            <p><em id="sig">Anyways,</em> all this to say rather than doing any of that, I'm up super late ranting on my homework in a small pop-up
            that I don't really expect people to read (will find a funny little meme of how awkward I feel when I actually have time and am more awake).
            And I just find it funny because people call me smart for knowing how to make this all look <em id="sig">pretty.</em>
